NAME
    DataPort::Maker - mimics a make by loading a database and calling
    targets methods

SYNOPSIS
     #####
     # Subroutine interface
     #
     use File::Maker qw(load_db);

     \%data = load_db($pm);

     ######
     # Object interface
     #
     require File::Maker;

     $maker = $maker->load_db($pm);

     $maker->make_targets(\%targets, @targets, \%options ); 
     $maker->make_targets(\%targets, \%options  ); 

     $maker = new File::Maker(@options);

    Generally, if a subroutine will process a list of options, "@options",
    that subroutine will also process an array reference, "\@options",
    "[@options]", or hash reference, "\%options", "{@options}". If a
    subroutine will process an array reference, "\@options", "[@options]",
    that subroutine will also process a hash reference, "\%options",
    "{@options}". See the description for a subroutine for details and
    exceptions.

DESCRIPTION
    The "File::Maker" program module provides a "make" style interface as
    shown in the herein above. The "@targets" contains a list of targets
    that mimics the targets of a "makefile". The targets are subroutines
    written in Perl in a separate program module from the "File::Maker". The
    separate target program module inherits the methods in the "File::Maker"
    program module as follows:

     use File::Maker;
     use vars qw( @ISA );
     @ISA = qw(File::Maker);

    The "File::Maker" methods will then find the target subroutines in the
    separate target program module.

    The "File::Maker" provides for the loading of a hash from a program
    module to provide for the capabilities of "defines" in a "makefile". The
    option "pm =" $file> tells "File::Maker" to load a database from the
    __DATA__ section of a program module that is in the Tie::Form format.
    The "Tie::Form" format is a very flexible lenient format that is about
    as close to a natural language form and still have the precision of
    being machine readable. This provides a more flexible alternative to the
    defines in a "makefile". The define hash is in a separate, very flexible
    form program module. This arrangement allows one target program module
    that inherits the "File::Maker" program module to produce as many
    different outputs as there are Tie::Form program modules.

METHODS
  load_db

     \%data = load_db($pm);
     $maker = $maker->load_db($pm);

    The "load_db" subroutine loads the "__DATA__" of "$pm" using "Tie::Form"
    progrma module. The results are return as a hash. If called as a object,
    the objec "$maker" have hash data. The return keys are as follows:

     key              description
     -------------------------------------------------------------- 
     FormDB_File      the absoute file of $pm
     FormDB_PM        $pm
     FormDB_Record    __DATA__ section of $pm
     FormDB           ordered name,value pairs of __DATA__ section

  make_targets

     $maker->make_targets(\%targets, @targets); 
     $maker->make_targets(\%targets, @targets, \%options); 

     $maker->make_targets(\%targets); 
     $maker->make_targets(\%targets, \%options);

    The "make_targets" subroutine executes the "@targets" in order after
    substituing an expanded list "$target[$targets[$i]}" list if it exists,
    as follows:

     $self->$target[$i]( @args )  

    The "@args" do not exists unless the "$taget[$i]" is itself an array
    reference in which case the "make_targets" subroutine assumes the array
    referenced is

     [$target, @args]

  new

     $maker = new File::Maker(@options);
     $maker = new File::Maker(\@options);
     $maker = new File::Maker(\%options);

    The "new" subroutine returns an object whose object data is a hash
    reference of "@options".

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    Running the test script "Maker.t" verifies the requirements for this
    module. The "tmake.pl" cover script for Test::STDmaker automatically
    generated the "Maker.t" test script, "Maker.d" demo script, and
    "t::File::Maker" STD program module POD, from the "t::File::Maker"
    program module contents. The "tmake.pl" cover script automatically ran
    the "Maker.d" demo script and inserted the results into the
    'DEMONSTRATION' section above. The "t::File::Maker" program module is in
    the distribution file File-Maker-$VERSION.tar.gz.

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, program modules, such the "File::Maker"
    module, extends the Perl language.

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, program modules, such the
    "DataPort::Maker" module, extends the Perl language.

    The "File::Maker" provides a "make" style interface for modules as shown
    below:

     \%targets, @targets, \%options 
     \%targets, @targets 
     \%targets, \%options

    The *\%targets* contains a list of targets that are supplied by the
    using program module. The option "-pm = file" tells "File::Maker" to
    load a database from the __DATA__ section of a program module that is in
    the Tie::Form format. This provides a more flexible alternative to the
    defines and macros in a "makefile".

  1.3 Document overview.

    the inventory, installation instructions and other information necessary
    to utilize and track this release.

    File-Maker-0.02
        Need a return at top of the "__DATA__" record to be compatible with
        obsolete "DataPort::Maker" program module.

        Restore "@INC" in "load_db" subroutine. Added test for the same.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    Instructions for installation, installation tests and installation
    support are as follows:

    Installation Instructions.
        To installed the release file, use the CPAN module pr PPM module in
        the Perl release or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

         http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

        Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

        If all else fails, the file may be manually installed. Enter one of
        the following repositories in a web browser:

          http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/
          http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

        Right click on 'File-Maker-0.03.tar.gz' and download to a temporary
        installation directory. Enter the following where $make is 'nmake'
        for microsoft windows; otherwise 'make'.

         gunzip File-Maker-0.03.tar.gz
         tar -xf File-Maker-0.03.tar
         perl Makefile.PL
         $make test
         $make install

        On Microsoft operating system, nmake, tar, and gunzip must be in the
        exeuction path. If tar and gunzip are not install, download and
        install unxutils from

         http://packages.softwarediamonds.com
