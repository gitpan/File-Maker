=head1 1.0 SCOPE

This paragraph identifies and provides an overview
of the released files.

=head2 1.1 Identification

This release,
identified in L<3.2|/3.2 Inventory of software contents>,
is a collection of Perl modules that
extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

=head2 1.2 System overview

The system is the Perl programming language software.
As established by the Perl referenced documents,
program modules, such the "File::Maker" module, extends the Perl language.

The system is the Perl programming language software.
As established by the Perl referenced documents,
program modules, such the "DataPort::Maker" module, extends the Perl language.

The C<File::Maker> provides a "make" style interface
for modules as shown below:
 
 \%targets, @targets, \%options 
 \%targets, @targets 
 \%targets, \%options

The I<\%targets> contains a list of targets that are supplied by the using
program module. The option C<-pm = file> tells C<File::Maker> to load
a database from the __DATA__ section of a program module that is in the
L<Tie::Form|Tie::Form> format.
This provides a more flexible alternative to the defines
and macros in a "makefile".
